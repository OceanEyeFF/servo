# Complex Project Entry Gate

> This is the template source for `.servo/repo/complex-project-entry-gate.md`. It records repo-init / existing-code-adoption complex-project gate evidence as runtime evidence. It is a Milestone-side blocking gate, not fixed heavy mode. Scanner output is evidence, not verdict.

## Trigger Signals

- trigger_conditions: pending_observed_signal_review

> Candidate trigger vocabulary includes weak-doc, large_repo, multi_service, migration_or_data_risk, deploy_or_network_surface, destructive_or_secret_surface, and authority_boundary_unclear. Record only observed signals in trigger_conditions.

- not_fixed_heavy_mode: true

## Verdict

> Weak-doc blockers should route to a reinforcement documentation / project-understanding Milestone before implementation-oriented Worktrack derivation.
> Use recommendation_status not_needed only when reinforcement is not required; use recommended, required, or pending_operator_review for blocking weak-doc routes.
